\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\subsection{Overview}
This paper is devoted to a simple mechanical
system with remarkable mathematical properties.
The \emph{infinite snake} is a sequence of 
identical rigid segments, connected by
planar rotating joints; each segment is
equipped with a wheel attached in the middle,
and the wheels roll 
on a plane with no slipping
or skidding (\textbf{figure}). The latter condition 
imposes non-holonomic constraints on the system's kinematics.
Our central observation is that
this kinematics realises, in a formal sense, the positive
subalgebra of the 
\emph{twisted loop algebra} of $\fsl_2(\RR)$. 

The statement is easy to formulate. Reducing by obvious translational
symmetry, the snake's configuration space may be identified with an
infinite torus $\TT^\infty = \varinjlim_{n\to\infty} \TT^n$, parameterising
the orientations of subsequent segments.
It is an exercise in imagination to see that the snake `follows its head':
that is, the motion of the entire system is determined by the initial configuration,
and the curve traced by the free endpoint of the first segment (\textbf{figure}). 
In particular, at every given configuration one may consider the two motions characterised
by the `head' moving along either axis of a fixed Cartesian coordinate system on the plane.
Infinitesimally, these correspond to a pair of vector fields $X$, $Y$ on $\TT^\infty$.
The Lie algebra $\fS$ generated by these two will be our main object of study.

Now, the twisted loop algebra referred to above is
$$
L_\theta\fsl_2(\RR) = \{ u(t)\ |\ u(-t)=-u(t)^T \} \subset \fsl_2(\RR)[t,t^{-1}] = L\fsl_2(\RR)
$$
where $\theta$ refers to the Cartan involution $u \mapsto -u^T$ on $\fsl_2(\RR)$.
The latter leads to a decomposition $\fsl_2(\RR) = \fso_2(\RR) \oplus \RR^2$ into eigenspaces,
and we may describe $L_\theta\fsl_2(\RR)$ as a $\ZZ$-graded Lie algebra with copies of 
$\fso_2(\RR)\simeq\RR$ in even degrees, and of $\RR^2$ in odd degrees.
The positive subalgebra $L_\theta^+\fsl_2(\RR)$ is the sum of positively graded subspaces:
$$
L_\theta^+\fsl_2(\RR) = L_\theta\fsl_2(\RR) \cap t \fsl_2(\RR)[t].
$$
Our main result then states that there is an orthogonal
basis $x,y\in\RR^2$ such that the map $X\mapsto tx$, $Y\mapsto ty$
extends to an \emph{isomorphism} of Lie algebras
$$\fS \simeq L_\theta^+\fsl_2(\RR). $$

The proof of this isomorphism is fairly non-trivial. We will exploit certain symmetries
of the snake to express the serpentine Lie algebra $\fS$ in a more abstract fashion,
and proceed with a rather explicit computation. 

\subsection{Motivaiton}
Truncating the snake's tail after finitely many segments
produces a finite system inheriting some properties of 
its infinite form. 
These finite snakes are interesting as actual
robotic systems effectuated by bending the joints (the wheels are passive). 
M. Ishikawa studied the three-segment snake in \textbf{[refs]},
coming up with a beautiful control-theoretic application of
principal connections and the Ambrose-Singer theorem. He also worked on other robots based on
effectuated joints and rigid segments with passive wheels, such as
the `trident snake' \textbf{[ref]}.

Around 2014, partly inspired by Ishikawa's work, P. Nurowski proposed 
a systematic study of the geometries associated with all snake-like systems: 
that is, planar graphs with edges corrseponding to rigid segments of fixed
length, some equipped with wheels at a fixed location along the edge. 
Given the configuration space $M$ of such a `generalised snake', 
the condition of no skidding and no skipping imposed on each wheel
gives rise to a constraint distribution $\sD \subset TM$ (one may 
exclude some degenerate configurations, thus restricting $M$ to an 
open subset over which $\sD$ has constant rank). Then one studies
the flag $\sD^\bullet$ defined inductively by $\sD^1 = \sD$,
$\sD^{i+1}=[\sD,\sD^i]$, so that $\sD^{i}$
is spanned by $i$-fold iterated Lie brackets of sections of $\sD$
(one may further shrink $M$ to an open subset over which
the $\sD^i$ have constant rank). Assuming the snake system is \emph{controllable},
i.e. that $\bigcup \sD^i=TM$, we have that $\sD^\bullet$
forms an exhaustive filtration of $TM$. One then studies the associated graded
bundle $\gr TM$, of rank equal to the dimension of $M$. By construction, the Lie
bracket of vector fields induces a Lie algebra structure in each fibre of $\gr TM$.
The graded nilpotent Lie algebra $\gr T_x M$ is called the \emph{symbol} of $\sD$ at $x$, and forms
an important local algebraic invariant of the non-holonomic distribution $\sD$.

Up to the data of segment lengths and wheel positions, these generalised snakes
are of combinatorial nature; in particular, as graphs, they admit an inductive
description, where a system is built by attaching edges (with or without wheels)
one at a time. Working in Nurowski's project, I considered the possibility of exploiting
such inductive descriptions to compute the symbol at a general configuration.
A more modest goal would be to predict the snake's \emph{growth vector}: that is
the sequence $(\rk\sD^i)_{i>0}$; equivalently, we might consider
$(\rk \gr_iTM)_{i>0}$, i.e. 
the sequence of dimensions
of graded homogeneous subspaces of the \emph{symbol} $\gr T_x M$ at a general point.
The former is the cumulative sum of the latter, which we may thus call the
\emph{growth rate vector}.

I've thus quickly arrived at the problem of computing the growth vector of
the $n$-segment snake -- the result of iteratively attaching a wheeled edge  
to a free endpoint of the system. An explicit calculation with help of computer
algebra gives the following results:
\begin{center}\fbox{
\begin{tabular}{c|l||c|l||c|l}
        $n$ & growth rate&
        $n$ & growth rate&
        $n$ & growth rate\\
        \hline
        1 & 2 1 & 
        4 & 2 1 2 1 &
        7 & 2 1 2 1 2 1
        \\
        2 & 2 1 1 &
        5 & 2 1 2 1 1 &
        8 & 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 
        \\
        3 & 2 1 2 &
        6 & 2 1 2 1 2 &
        9 & 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
\end{tabular}
}\end{center}
A clear pattern emerges -- how does one explain it?
Up to some irregularity at the `tail', the growth rate
vector appears to be a string of 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 \dots,
suggesting that the results for finite snakes may be the shadow
of a simpler situation in the limit $n\to\infty$. 

There are some remarkable features of the snake to be pointed out in this context.
First, the symbol (at a general point) of each of the $n$-segment
snakes appears to have \emph{width} 2 (that is the bound on
the dimensions of homogeneous graded components). This is
very far from the generic situation, and puts the sequence
of snakes in a similar category as the much studied sequence
of \emph{trailers}, systems with growth rate 2 1 1 1 \dots (indeed, deforming the $n$-segment snake
by varying the position of the wheels, and then degerating by moving each wheel to
an endpoint of its segment, one ends up with an $n$-segment trailer). 
Second, in the infinite snake, the symbol of $\sD$ actually coincides with
the Lie algebra generated by the vector fields $X, Y$ spanning $\sD$ (that doesn't
happen for finite snakes, where -- unlike the symbol -- the algebra generated
by the two vector fields isn't nilpotent).
All these points will be taken up more formally in Section \ref{sec:further}.

\subsection{Approach}
It is easy to \emph{conjecture} the isomorphism $\fS \simeq L^+_\theta\fsl_2(\RR)$
based on explicit computation,\footnote{I've presented the conjecture and some of its
ramifications at a 2015 Bedlewo workshop on Nonlinear Control.}
but actually proving it requires tackling two infinities: the depth of iterated Lie brackets,
and the length of the snake.
The former involves straightforward induction on bracket depth.
The latter will be approached through a less obvious \emph{corecursion}.

The corecursion is related
to a particular `symmetry' of the infinite snake that becomes broken
in its finite sub-snakes:
namely, the tail, that is the
snake minus its initial segment,
is still an infinite snake.\footnote{Of course cutting the snake's head off
is not invertible, whence one should rather speak of a \emph{pseudo-}symmetry.}
This gives rise to a `shift operation', passing from the original snake to its
tail. We shall furhter twist it using the obvious Euclidean symmetry of the system
(since we have already reduced the configuration space by translations,
we are left with rotations and reflections). 

So far, we haven't really specified the parameterisation identifying the infinite snake's
reduced configuration space with $\TT^\infty$. Let us temporarily denote the
former more abstractly as $M$. Now, identify the configuration space
of the one-segment snake with $\TT$, parameterised by an angle coordinate $\varphi$
such that $\varphi=0$ corresponds to the segment being aligned with the first
Cartesian axis (the one associated with $X$). Let $$ \TT \xleftarrow{\pi_h} M \xrightarrow{\pi_t} M $$
be the projections sending the configuration $m$ of an infinite snake 
to, respectively, the configuration of its initial segment, $\pi_h(m)$,
and the configuration
of its tail \emph{as} an infinite snake, $\pi_t(m)$.
Now, let $$ S, R_\vartheta : M \to M $$
denote the symmetries induced by, respectively,
reflection about the first Cartesian axis, and
rotation by $\vartheta \in \TT$. Define
$$ R : \TT \times M \to M,\quad R(\vartheta, m) = R_\vartheta(m) $$ 
and 
consider the \emph{invertible} map
$$
\Phi : M \xrightarrow{\langle \pi_h,\pi_t\rangle} \TT \times M
\xrightarrow{\langle \pr_1, S \circ R\rangle} \TT \times M.
$$
That is, $\Phi$ sends a configuration of the infinite snake
to the pair: the configuration of its initial segment, and
the configuration of its tail, but in a coordinate system
whose first axis is parallel to the initial segment, and
whose orientation is reflected.

Iterating the map $\Phi$ produces a sequence of invertible maps
$\Phi^{(n)} : M \to \TT^n \times M$ and, in the limit,
an identification 
$$\pr_1 \circ \Phi^{(\infty)} : M \longrightarrow \TT^\infty = \varprojlim_{n\to\infty} \TT^n.$$
With standard angle coordinates $(\varphi_1,\varphi_2,\dots)$ on $\TT^\infty$,
the above identification corresponds to parameterising the infinite snake
as in Figure~\ref{fig:param}.

It turns out that the vector fields $X$, $Y$ admit a convenient corecursive
description with respect to $\Phi$. Let $\XX^\p(M)$ denote the space of
smooth projectable vector fields on $M$ (that is an inverse limit of 
spaces of smooth projectable vector fields on the configuration spaces of finite sub-snakes),
and let
$$ \XX(\TT) \xrightarrow{\iota} \XX^\p(M) \xleftarrow{\Sigma} \XX^\p(M) $$
be the maps induced by $\Phi^{-1} :  \TT\times M \to M$. Note that these in turn induce
an isomorphism\footnote{For simplicity, at this stage we use
smooth functions, whence the need for a completed tensor product.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:algebra} we will actually 
work with Laurent polynomials on complex tori.}
$$
\XX(\TT) \oplus C^\infty(\TT) \widehat\otimes \XX^p(M) \to \XX^\p(M),
\quad
(v, f \otimes V) \mapsto \iota v + (\pi_h^* f)\cdot \Sigma V.
$$
It will be most convenient to complexify and consider
$Z = X+iY \in \CC\otimes\XX^\p(M)$.
Then, we find the following corecursive formula (see Section~\ref{sec:basic}):
$$
Z = -e^{i\varphi} \left( 
        \Sigma Z + i(\Sigma-1)\iota\partial_\varphi
\right)$$
where we view $\varphi$ as a function on $M$ via $\pi_h^*$.
Since the operator $1+e^{i\varphi}\Sigma$ 
is invertible on $\XX^\p(M)$, the above does indeed determine $Z$. A
conjugate formula holds for $\overline Z = X - iY$, and it is not unreasonable
to expect such recursive formulas for their iterated Lie brackets.
These are derived in Section \ref{sec:algebra}. In particular,
we find that the Lie algebra $\fS_\CC$ generated by $Z, \overline Z$
(a complexification of $\fS$) is isomorphic to $L_\theta^+\fsl_2(\CC)$.
Then, passing to real forms we conclude with $\fS\simeq L_\theta^+\fsl_2(\RR)$.

\section{Basic construction}
\label{sec:basic}
\subsection{A single segment}
Given the inductive construction of the snake system,
it is clear we need to begin with studying the behaviour of a single
segment. We are interested with how the single segment's kinematics
translate the motions of one endpoint into those of the other -- for then,
viewing the infinite snake as a chain of segments, we will be able
to propagate the motions of its head toward subsequent joints, along the tail. 
Remarkably, the Lie algebra $\fsl_2(\RR)$ shows up already at this stage. 
What
we state here is not new, and may be pursued far deeper (cf. {\bf[Bor-Levi-Perline-Tabachnikov]})

\begin{figure} % one segment; transfer

                \draw (-1,0) arc (180:216:1);
                \draw (3.2,2.4) arc (216:252:1);
                \draw (-0.72,-0.54) arc (216:252:0.9);
        \end{tikzpicture}\end{center}
        \caption{End-to-end translation in a single segment (all indicated angles
        are equal).\label{fig:seg}}
\end{figure}

Let $M_1$ be the configuration space of the single segment, moving along
a Euclidean plane identified with $\RR^2$.
Assume the segment has unit length, and fix an ordering of its two endpoints.
We then have three well-defined projections:
$$
 \varphi : M_1 \to \TT,\quad p_0, p_1 : M_1 \rightrightarrows \RR^2
$$
mapping the segment's configuration to, respectively,
its orientation, and the positions of the two endpoints.
Identifying $\TT$ with the unit circle in $\RR^2$, we have the relation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:seg-rel} p_1(m) - p_0(m) = \varphi(m)\quad\textrm{for}\ m \in M_1.\end{equation}
Identifying $T_{p_0(m)}\RR^2, T_{p_1(m)}\RR^2$ with $\RR^2$
using the Euclidean structure,
the no-slip-or-skid condition
on $v \in T_m M_1$ becomes 
\begin{equation}
        \label{eq:seg-cons}
        (p_{0*}v + p_{1*}v) \wedge \varphi(m) = 0\quad \textrm{in}\ \Lambda^2\RR^2.
\end{equation}
Let us further identify $T_{\varphi(m)}\TT \simeq \RR$  and $\Lambda^2\RR^2 \simeq \RR$
using the Euclidean structure on $\RR^2$.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:seg-trans}
        Suppose $v \in T_m M_1$ satisfies \eqref{eq:seg-cons}. Then
        \begin{align}
                p_{1*}v & = S_{\varphi(m)}\  p_{0*}v,\\
                \varphi_*v&= -2\varphi(m)\wedge p_{0*}v,
        \end{align}
        where $S_u \in \End\RR^2$ denotes reflection in the axis $\RR u$ for $u \in \TT$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
        Let $P_u \in \End\RR^2$ be the orthogonal projection onto $\RR u$ for $u \in \TT$.
        By \eqref{eq:seg-cons}, $(1-P_{\varphi(m)}) p_{1*}v = - (1-P_{\varphi(m)}) p_{0*}v$. On the other hand,
        differentiating \eqref{eq:seg-rel} we have $P_{\varphi(m)} p_{1*}v=P_{\varphi(m)} p_{0*}v$. It follows that
        $p_{1*}v = (2P_{\varphi(m)}-1)p_{0*v} = S_{\varphi(m)}p_{0*v}$, proving the first formula.
        Using \eqref{eq:seg-rel} again 
        we have $$\varphi_* v = p_{1*}v-p_{0*}v = (S_{\varphi(m)}-1) (p_{0*}v) = -2(1-P_{\varphi(m)}) (p_{0*}v)$$
        in $\RR^2$.
        Since $(u\wedge) \circ (1-P_u) = (u\wedge)$ for $u \in \TT$, the second formula follows
        once one identifies $T_{\varphi(m)}\TT\simeq\RR\simeq\Lambda^2\RR^2$.
\end{proof}
In other words, the infinitesimal motions of the two endpoints
are related by a reflection in the axis spanned by the segment,
see Figure~\ref{fig:seg}. As a consequence, movement of the first endpoint 
determines that of the second endpoint, a property we will use to
propagate motion along the actual snake. 

It also determines the evolution of the orientation of the segment.
Let us consider the map
$$ \xi : \RR^2 \xrightarrow{ p_{0*}^{-1}}  \XX(M_1)^{\RR^2} \xrightarrow{\varphi_*} \XX(\TT) $$
where $\XX(M_1)^{\RR^2}$ is the space of vector fields on $M_1$
invariant under the translation action of $\RR^2$ (and thus with well-defined projections onto
$\TT$). Given a vector $v \in \RR^2$, dragging the first endpoint
of the segment along $v$ produces $\xi(v)$ as the corresponding
vector field on the \emph{reduced} configuration space $\TT$ of the segment.
Remarkably, these vector fields generate the `standard' infinitesimal action of $\fsl_2(\RR)$
on the circle.
\begin{lem}
        Let $\fsl_2(\RR) = \fso_2(\RR) \oplus \fm$ be the decomposition
        of the Lie algebra $\fsl_2(\RR)$ into eigenspaces of the Cartan
        involution $x\mapsto-x^T$. Then there exists a Lie algebra monomorphism
        $$ \eta : \fsl_2(\RR) \to \XX(\TT) $$
        and an $\SO_2(\RR)$-equivariant isomorphism $\fm\simeq\RR^2$
        such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item $\eta|_{\fso_2(\RR)}$ acts naturally by infinitesimal rotations of $\TT\subset \RR^2$,
                \item $\eta|_\fm$ coincides with $\xi$ under $\fm\simeq\RR^2$.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
        Let us compute explicitly with a standard Euclidean basis $e_1,e_2 \in \RR^2$
        and an angle coordinate $\phi$ on $\TT$. Let
        \begin{align*}
               2r &= e_2\otimes e_1^* - e_1\otimes e_2^* \\
               2p &= e_2\otimes e_1^* + e_1\otimes e_2^* \\
               2q & =e_1\otimes e_1^* - e_2\otimes e_2^*
        \end{align*}
        so that $\fso_2(\RR) = \langle r\rangle$, $\fm = \langle p,q\rangle$
        and we have
        $[r, p]= -q$, $[r,q]=p$, $[p,q]=r$.
        By (1), we have $\eta(r) = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\phi$.
        Then, writing $\eta(p) = f_p(\phi)\partial_\phi$ and $\eta(q) = f_q(\phi)\partial_\phi$ and
        imposing the above Lie brackets,
        one finds 
        $$ \eta(p) = \cos\phi\partial_\phi,\quad \eta(q) = \sin\phi\partial_\phi $$
        \emph{up to conjugation} by $\SO_2(\RR)$.
        .....
\end{proof}

\section{Serpentine Lie algebra}
\label{sec:algebra}
\subsection{Algebraic setup}
We work with the following objects:
\begin{align*}
        \fsl_2&=\CC\langle \e,\h,\f\rangle & & [\h,\e]=2\e\ [\h,\f]=-2\f,\ [\f,\e]=\h \\
        A  &= \CC\{z^{\pm1},\Sigma\} & & \textrm{(non-commutative $\CC$-algebra)} \\
        \fM  &= A \otimes \fsl_2       & & \textrm{(left $A$-module)}
\end{align*}
and their completions
$$        \widehat A = \varprojlim_k A / \langle\Sigma\rangle^k,\quad
        \widehat \fM = \varprojlim_k \fM / \langle\Sigma\rangle^k\fM 
$$
with respect to the two-sided ideal generated by $\Sigma$ in $A$.
They are equipped with compatible involutions
$$
\fsl_2 \xrightarrow{\tau} \fsl_2,\quad A \xrightarrow{\tau} A,\quad \fM \xrightarrow{\tau} \fM,\quad \dots
$$
where
$\e^\tau=-\f$, $\h^\tau=\h$, $\f^\tau=-\e$, $z^\tau=z^{-1}$ and $\Sigma^\tau=\Sigma$.
The Lie algebra $\fsl_2$ acts on $\CC[z^{\pm1}] \subset A$:
$$ \e\cdot z^p=pz^{p+1},\quad \h\cdot z^p=2pz^p,\quad \f\cdot z^p=pz^{p-1}, $$ 
and the action is compatible with $\tau$.

Our next goal is to introduce a Lie algebra structure on 
$\fM$ and $\widehat\fM$. There is a split short exact sequence
$$ 0 \to \CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes_\CC A \xrightarrow{\iota} A \rightleftarrows \CC[z^{\pm1}] \to 0 $$
of $\CC[z^{\pm1}]$-modules, with $\iota(f\otimes a) = f\Sigma a$
and the image of $\iota$ identified with $\langle\Sigma\rangle$. This induces
another 
split short exact sequence of $\CC[z^{\pm1}]$-modules:
\begin{equation} 0 \to \CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes_\CC \fM \xrightarrow{\iota\otimes\id_{\fsl_2}} \fM \overset{\pi}{\underset{\sigma}{\rightleftarrows}} \CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2 \to 0 
\label{eq:ses-m}
\end{equation}
Observe that the $\fsl_2$-action on $\CC[z^{\pm1}]$ equips
the factor $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2$ with a Lie-Rinehart algebra structure:
$$ [f x, g y] = fg[x,y]_{\fsl_2} + f(x\cdot g)y-g(y\cdot f)x $$
for $x,y\in\fsl_2$ and $f,g\in\CC[z^{\pm1}]$.
This Lie algebra then acts on $\CC[z^{\pm1}]$ by derivations.

\begin{prop}\label{pro:m}
        There is a unique Lie algebra structure on $\fM$ such that
        \eqref{eq:ses-m} becomes a split short exact sequence of Lie algebras, with:
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item (cokernel) $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2$ being the Lie-Rinehart algebra for the $\fsl_2$-action on 
                        $\CC[z^{\pm1}]$,
                \item (kernel) $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes_\CC\fM$ equipped with a $\CC[z^{\pm1}]$-linear
                       Lie algebra structure by extension of scalars,
                \item  (twisting) $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2$ acting on $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes_\CC\fM$
                       via its natural action on the first factor.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
        Note that a split short exact sequence such as \eqref{eq:ses-m},
        along with Lie algebra structures on the kernel and cokernel,
        plus the latter acting by derivations on the former,
        would normally define a Lie algebra structure on the middle term.
        Here however, the structure on the kernel $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes_\CC\fM$
        is defined in terms of the very Lie algebra structure on $\fM$ we wish
        to define!

        Let us denote by $B \subset \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$ the set 
        of Lie algebra structures on $\fM$, and
        by $B_\pi\subset B$ the subset of structures for which $\pi$ becomes
        a Lie algebra homomorphism (onto the Lie-Rinehart algebra).
        Given $b \in B$, write $\fM_b$ for $\fM$ equipped with the Lie algebra
        structure $b$. Then, the short exact sequence \eqref{eq:ses-m} lifts
        to a sequence of Lie algebra homomorphisms
        $$ 0 \to \CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes_\CC \fM_b \to \fM_{b'} \rightleftarrows \CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2\to 0$$
        for a unique $b' \in B_\pi$ such that
        the conditions (1), (2), (3) of the Lemma are satisfied.

        This defines a self-map $b\mapsto b'$ of $B$ with image
        contained in $B_\pi$. To prove the Lemma 
        we need to show that $b\mapsto b'$ possesses a unique fixed point.
        Note that the map extends to an \emph{affine} self-map 
        $$\Phi : \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM) \to \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$$ such that $b'=\Phi(b)$.
        Indeed, given $\omega \in \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$ we use
        the split exact sequence to decompose
        $$ \fM \simeq \left(\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2\right) \oplus \left(\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fM\right) $$ 
        and then write $\Phi(\omega)=\omega'$ with
$$ 
\omega'\left(
\left[\begin{matrix}f\otimes x \\ f'\otimes\alpha\end{matrix}\right], \left[\begin{matrix}g\otimes y \\ g'\otimes\beta\end{matrix}\right]\right) 
= 
\left[\begin{matrix}
[f\otimes x,g\otimes y]_{\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2} 
\\
f'g'\otimes\omega(\alpha,\beta) 
+ f(x\cdot g')\otimes\beta - g(y\cdot f)\otimes\alpha
\end{matrix}\right].$$

In particular, $\Phi$ is a `contraction mapping' in the sense
that
$$
\omega_1 - \omega_2 \in \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM, \langle\Sigma\rangle^k \fM) \implies 
\Phi(\omega_1)-\Phi(\omega_2) \in \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\langle\Sigma\rangle^{k+1}\fM).
$$
It follows that, given $\omega_0 \in \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$, we have
a well-defined limit
$$\Phi^\infty(\omega_0) \in \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM, \widehat\fM)$$
satisfying
$$\Phi^\infty(\omega_0) \equiv \Phi^k(\omega_0)\quad\textrm{mod $\Hom(\Lambda^2\fM, \langle\Sigma\rangle^k\fM)$}. $$
Note that $\Phi^\infty(\omega_1)=\Phi^\infty(\omega_2)$
for any $\omega_1,\omega_2\in\Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$,
since their difference maps $\Lambda^2\fM$ to $\bigcap_k \langle\Sigma\rangle^k\fM=0$.
Let us then set
$$b = \Phi^\infty(0).$$
We claim that $b$ is actually contained in $\Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$ rather
than the completion. 

Indeed, consider the increasing filtration $F^\bullet A$
where $F^kA$ is spanned by monomials of degree at most $k$ in $\Sigma$; extend
it to $F^\bullet\fM = F^\bullet A \otimes \fsl_2$. Let $V \subset \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\widehat\fM)$
be the subspace consisting of $\omega$ such that $\omega(F^k, F^k) \subset F^k$ for all $k\ge 0$.
The following properties are easily verified:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item $V$ is contained in $\Hom(\Lambda^2\fM, \fM)$,
        \item $\Phi(V) \subset V$.
        \item $V$ is closed for the topology generated by translates of $\Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\langle\Sigma\rangle^k\widehat\fM)$, $k\ge0$.
\end{enumerate}
The latter means explicitly that $$\bigcap_k (V + \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\langle \Sigma^k\rangle\widehat\fM)) = V.$$
Properties (2) and (3) imply $\Phi^\infty(V)\subset V$; since $0 \in V$, it follows that
$b \in V$. Then by property (1) we have $b \in  \Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$.

We conclude that $b$ is the unique fixed point of $\Phi$ in $\Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\fM)$.
Since $0 \in B$, $\Phi^k(0) \in B$ for $k>0$. Note that
$B$, being cut out by the Jacobi identity, 
is again closed for the topology mentioned in (3). Explicitly, this means that
if there is a sequence $b_0,b_1,\dots \in B$
such that $b = b_k$ modulo $\Hom(\Lambda^2\fM,\langle \Sigma\rangle^k\fM)$,
then $b \in B$. Taking $b_k=\Phi^k(0)$ we then have
$b \in B$, and in fact $b = \Phi(b) \in B_\pi$.
\end{proof}

We shall henceforth use the structure
described in Proposition~\ref{pro:m} as \emph{the} Lie algebra structure
on $\fM$. It is convenient to list explicit equations allowing for
recursive calculation:
\begin{align}
        [f x, g y] &= fg[x,y]_{\fsl_2} + f(x\cdot g)y-g(y\cdot f)x \label{eq:str00} \\
        [f x, g \Sigma \alpha] &=f (x\cdot g)\Sigma\alpha \label{eq:str01} \\
        [f \Sigma\alpha, g\Sigma\beta ] &= fg \Sigma[\alpha,\beta] \label{eq:str11}
\end{align}
for $f,g \in \CC[z^{\pm1}]$; $x,y \in \fsl_2$; $\alpha,\beta \in \fM$.
In fact, these extend to $\widehat\fM$:
\begin{lem}\label{lem-mhat}
        $\langle\Sigma\rangle^k\fM$ is a Lie ideal for each $k>0$,
        so that the Lie algebra structure of $\fM$ extends naturally to the completion $\widehat\fM$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
        Proceed by induction on $k$, with the base case $k=0$ being trivial.
        Assume $\langle \Sigma\rangle^{k-1}\fM$ is a Lie ideal in $\fM$.
        Then, by \eqref{eq:str01} and \eqref{eq:str11}, so is
        $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\Sigma\langle\Sigma\rangle^{k-1}\fM = \langle\Sigma\rangle^k\fM$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}\label{lem-mtau}
        The involution $\tau$ is compatible with the Lie algebra structure on $\fM$ (resp. $\widehat \fM$).
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
        Note first that $\tau$ is compatible with the Lie-Rinehart algebra structure on 
        $\CC[z^{\pm1}]\otimes\fsl_2$. Now, let $\alpha,\beta \in \fM$.
        By construction of the Lie algebra structure on $\fM$
        and induction on $k$,
        we have that $[\alpha^\tau,\beta^\tau] - [\alpha,\beta]^\tau \in \langle\Sigma\rangle^k\fM$
        for all $k\ge0$. Since $\bigcap_k\langle\Sigma\rangle^k\fM=0$, it follows that
        $[\alpha^\tau,\beta^\tau]=[\alpha,\beta]^\tau$. Finally, the same holds for $\widehat\fM$
        by continuity of $\tau$ with respect to the $\Sigma$-adic topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
        The \emph{abstract serpentine Lie algebra} is 
        the smallest $\tau$-stable subalgebra of $\widehat \fM$
        containing an element $\zeta$ satisfying
        $\zeta + z\Sigma(\zeta - \h/2) - \e = 0$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
        The abstract serpentine Lie algebra is isomorphic
        to $\fS_\CC$, with $\zeta$ (resp. $\zeta^\tau)$ identified with $Z = X+iY$
        (resp. $\overline Z=X-iY$).
